Now, please meticulously and review and analyze the project's static landing page mockup HTML attached to have a deep understanding of the WHAT, WHY and HOW of the project. Next, thoroughly review both the static HTML mockup and the comprehensive Project Architecture Document to gain a complete understanding of *Atelier Arôme* that is a masterclass in digital alchemy that transforms aromatherapy into an immersive Renaissance manuscript experience.

# The project stands out with its:
- Renaissance Manuscript Aesthetic with distinctive typography and alchemical metaphors
- Sophisticated Technical Architecture using Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Prisma
- Multi-sensory Experience incorporating haptic feedback and spatial audio
- Artisanal E-commerce approach that makes shopping feel like collecting rare specimens

First, think deeper and think harder to re-imagine the final codebase holistically - how to develop the whole codebase with accompanying database schema, and to be able to do so without ambiguity and deviation. Then meticulously create a comprehensive implementation plan for the codebase. Review and validate the implementation plan to build the entire codebase for the project before proceeding cautiously to execute it.

# sample template for codebase completion implementation phases:

[ ] Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture Setup - Create project structure, dependencies, and core configuration
[ ] Phase 2: Design System Implementation - Build manuscript aesthetic with Tailwind CSS, custom tokens, and decorative elements
